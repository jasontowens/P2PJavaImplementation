notes:
	- we have a NeighborInfo class for maintaining necessary information about peers so that choking/unchoking decisions can be made
	- we have proper initialization of a client and server per peer, and pass a reference to them.
		- uncomment peerProcess.java line 216 to see the server spin up nicely with all necessary info
		- we have not properly modified the sample code for client and server to properly handle ByteBuffers instead of whatever they currently use
	- we have proper message handling based on what type of message it is
		- we still have to handle piece and bitfield messages, but the others are good
	- proper processing of config files
	- each neighbor properly recognizes its neighbors

todo:
	- choking + peer management (timers, etc)
	- actual message passing between sockets
		- handling multiple connections as well

All of the customization / set up is done, now we just have to get down to the message passing and choking.
if we are a little behind, one of our group members was truly ill the whole past week and was unable to help - has doctor's note if necessary.

Best,
Team BJT
